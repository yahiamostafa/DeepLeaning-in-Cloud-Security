# DeepLeaning-in-Cloud-Security
We used deep learning algorithms in order to build an
intrusion detection system with higher classification accuracies either in the binary classifi-
cation or in the multi classification. In this thesis we have proposed different deep learning
models namely MLP, CNN2D and CNN1D. CNN1D has the highest performance in binary
classification achieving 91.4 % on KDDTest+ and 87.8 % on KDDTest-21 while MLP2 has the
highest performance in multi classification achieving 86.56 % on KDDTest+ and 80.09 % on
KDDTest-21. CNN1D overcomes deep learning and machine learning models in binary classi-
fication where it has a higher accuracy than other model by difference 4.1 % on KDDTest+ and
2.86 % on KDDTest-21. Also MLP2 overcomes deep learning and machine learning models
in multi classification where it has a higher accuracy than other model by difference 2.31 % on
KDDTest+ and 10.67 % on KDDTest-21. To sum up we believe our models are very strong
and powerful to be used in an intrusion detection system.
